# Entity-Recognition-from-twitter

Developed a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to extract entities such as persons, organizations, locations etc from Twitter corpus. A bidirectional Long Short Term Memory model has been implemented for this function to take into account both right and left context of the token. Was able to produce results which had a precision of 85% in the validation data and a precision of 74% in the test data in finding the geographical location from a tweet. After generating batches of same length tweets with padding, the LSTM network was used to produce probability distribution over tags for each token in a sentence. Building an LSTM network involved:(i) Declaring placeholders(ii) Building layers with computing forward cells and backward cells(iii) Computing predictions(iv) Computing loss and performing optimization(v) Train the network and predict tags
